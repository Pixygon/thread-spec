# Presence Topology — v0.1

**Status:** Draft · **Layer:** Presence · **Companion to:**
[presence-wire-v0.1](presence-wire-v0.1.md)

The wire spec fixes *how two endpoints exchange poses*. This spec fixes *how
presence is organized* so it is **scalable, seamless, and survivable** — able to
hold large crowds, hide jitter, and keep working when any single operator (Pixygon
included) disappears. The governing principle mirrors decentralized hosting:

> **Presence is federated. A world names its own relay(s); no global server is
> required, and no single party owns the network.** The standard is the wire, not
> any server.

## 1. Why not one relay

A single global relay is the presence equivalent of a single registry: a bottleneck,
a scaling ceiling, and a single point of death. It fails all three requirements —
so the topology is designed to avoid it at every level.

## 2. The tiers

A world picks a presence tier the way it picks hosting: **static-first, upgrade as
needed.** Each tier is independent of any specific operator.

| Tier | Who runs it | Scale | Survives operator loss |
|------|-------------|-------|------------------------|
| **0 · Solo** | nobody | 1 | trivially (no traffic) |
| **1 · P2P mesh** | the participants | small (≤ ~16) | fully — no server at all |
| **2 · Relay** | any host (the world's own) | thousands / instance | yes — relay is commodity, self-hostable, swappable |
| **3 · Sharded / federated** | many relay instances | very large | yes — no instance is special |

A world declares its tier implicitly through its manifest `presence` block:

```jsonc
"presence": {
  "mode": "relay",                       // "solo" | "p2p" | "relay" (default inferred)
  "relays": ["wss://a.example/thread/x",  // ordered: primary, then fallbacks
             "wss://b.example/thread/x"],
  "relay": "wss://a.example/thread/x",    // legacy single (compat; see relay_list())
  "max_occupants": 64,
  "voice": true
}
```

Absent a relay/mode → **Tier 0**. This is the whole of the required surface; the
rest of this document is how browsers and relays behave within it.

### 2.1 The creator's whole decision (three words)

A creator picks one of three things and is done — in Thread markup it is one
attribute on `<world>`:

```html
<world presence="none">                       <!-- people off (the default) -->
<world presence="p2p">                        <!-- participants host each other -->
<world presence="wss://relay.example/thread/x"> <!-- hosted: your relay (comma = fallbacks) -->
```

- **`none`** — Tier 0. Nothing to run, nothing to configure.
- **`p2p`** — the room is hosted by its participants: the first traveler whose
  browser *allows hosting* (a passport-level setting, off by default — hosting
  opens a listening port) becomes the room's host; if they leave, the next
  willing traveler takes over (§3). No creator infrastructure at all.
- **a relay URL** — hosted: the creator runs (or rents) any conformant relay
  and names it. Everything else (fallbacks, sharding) is optional growth.

### 2.2 Owner-tied rooms (`owner_required`) — a home with guests over

A traveler's **home** is the special p2p case: its host is always its owner —
you cannot volunteer to host someone else's home. The manifest a home serves to
guests carries:

```jsonc
"presence": { "mode": "p2p", "relays": ["ws://<host>:<port>/thread/home"],
              "owner_required": true }
```

`owner_required: true` declares that **the room lives only while its owner is
present**. The rule needs no enforcement protocol — the owner's browser IS the
host, so when the owner leaves (or quits), the host stops and every guest
socket closes with it. A browser that finds itself in an `owner_required`
world whose room has died SHOULD walk the traveler back to their *own* home
(after a short reconnect grace) rather than leave them in a dead copy: the
visit is over when the host goes home.

**Invite addresses.** A browser hosting a place serves its manifest over plain
HTTP on the same port as the room (`GET /.well-known/thread/world.json`), so
the invite is an ordinary Locator with a port — `thread://192.0.2.17:4200` —
and resolution is the standard `.well-known` fetch. A host carrying an
explicit port resolves over `http://` (LAN/direct invites); bare hosts remain
TLS-only. Reachability across NATs is the rendezvous tier's job (§3.2);
port-carrying invites are the LAN/VPN floor that works with no infrastructure.

## 3. Tier 1 — P2P mesh (serverless)

For small gatherings, presence needs **no dedicated server**. Peers connect
directly (WebRTC data channels), each sending its pose to the others. The only
shared infrastructure is a **stateless rendezvous** used once, at join, to
introduce peers (exchange SDP/ICE) — it never sees poses and holds no session
state, so it can be a tiny edge function, a public signaling service, or even
another peer.

- **Coordinate frame, pose shape, timing** — identical to the wire spec. A peer is
  just a relay-of-one from its neighbours' point of view.
- **`ts` in a mesh:** with no server clock, the *sender* stamps `ts` from its own
  monotonic clock and peers interpolate against *that sender's* recent timeline
  (never across senders). Velocity `v` still drives extrapolation.
- **Bound:** meshes are O(n²) in connections; cap at ~16 occupants, then a world
  SHOULD upgrade to Tier 2. Discovery of the cap is via the rendezvous.
- **Survivability:** if every server on earth is gone, two people who can reach
  each other still share presence. This is the floor the whole design guarantees.

### 3.1 Declaring P2P: the `rendezvous` field

A P2P world names its rendezvous in an **explicit `presence.rendezvous` field**
(never as a `relays` entry). The rendezvous speaks a *different protocol* (the
`Signal` introduction wire, §3.2) with different failure semantics — if it is
unreachable, an *existing* mesh keeps working, whereas a dead relay ends presence.
Keeping the fields distinct means `relays` keeps its ordered-failover meaning
unconditionally: when both are present, `relays` is the **Tier-2 fallback** a
browser uses when the mesh can't form (rendezvous down, NAT traversal failed, or
the mesh is at capacity) — the hybrid story.

### 3.2 The rendezvous protocol (`Signal` wire)

A rendezvous is a WebSocket endpoint at **`wss://<host>/rtc/<key>`** — the `/rtc`
path distinguishes it from a relay's `/thread/<key>` when both share a host, and
`<key>` follows the same opaque, fully-qualified room-key convention. Messages are
JSON, tagged `"t"` (lowercase):

```jsonc
{"t":"announce","peer":<u32>,"world":"<key>"}   // client → rv, on join (provisional id)
{"t":"welcome","id":<u32>}                      // rv → client: server-assigned id (OPTIONAL)
{"t":"peers","peers":[<u32>,…]}                 // rv → client: who's already present
{"t":"offer","from":<u32>,"to":<u32>,"sdp":"…"}       // relayed blindly to `to`
{"t":"answer","from":<u32>,"to":<u32>,"sdp":"…"}      // relayed blindly to `to`
{"t":"candidate","from":<u32>,"to":<u32>,"candidate":"…"} // relayed blindly to `to`
{"t":"leave","peer":<u32>}                      // rv → room, on a disconnect
```

- The client's `announce.peer` id is **provisional**. A rendezvous SHOULD assign
  ids (`welcome`, sent **before** `peers`) so ids never collide; a client MUST
  adopt the `welcome` id. A minimal rendezvous MAY omit `welcome`, in which case
  clients keep their self-picked ids (collision risk is the operator's choice).
- Glare avoidance: for each pair in `peers`, the **lower id offers**
  (`should_offer(me, other) = me < other`).
- **The join delta is REQUIRED**: on an `announce`, besides `peers` to the
  newcomer, the rendezvous MUST send `{"t":"peers","peers":[<newcomer>]}` to every
  member already in the room. Without it the pair rule deadlocks: with assigned
  ids the newcomer always has the *highest* id, so the offer is the existing
  (lower-id) member's to make — and it can't offer to a peer it never heard of.
- The rendezvous holds an ephemeral per-room peer set and relays `offer` /
  `answer` / `candidate` to the peer named in `to`, **verbatim**, same room only.
  It **never sees a pose** and holds no durable state — restart-safe, cattle not
  pets. Reference implementation:
  [`thread-rendezvous`](https://github.com/Pixygon/thread-engine/tree/main/crates/thread-rendezvous) (self-certifying; probe a
  live one with `thread-conformance --rendezvous wss://…/rtc/<key>`).

## 4. Tier 2 — Relay

One conformant relay instance per world (the reference is
[`thread-relay`](https://github.com/Pixygon/thread-engine/tree/main/crates/thread-relay)). The relay assigns occupant ids, stamps
`ts`, maintains the occupant list, and fans out within **area-of-interest** (§6).

- **Federation:** the world names the relay; different worlds (even different hosts)
  use different relays. There is no cross-world coupling and no central directory.
- **Failover:** `relays` is an ordered list. A browser tries them in order and uses
  the first reachable one; if its relay dies mid-session it MAY reconnect to the
  next (re-`join`, receive a fresh `welcome`). No single URL is a point of failure.
- **Statelessness:** a relay holds only ephemeral occupant positions. A restart just
  means clients reconnect — nothing durable is lost, so instances are cattle, not
  pets, and horizontal scaling is free.

## 5. Tier 3 — Sharding & relay federation

A single very large world scales by **sharding into cells** (by area, or by named
sub-zone). Each cell is an independent relay responsibility; a client is in exactly
one cell at a time and hands off at boundaries (re-`join` the neighbouring cell,
which the current relay advertises).

For a crowd spanning cells handled by *different relay instances*, relays **federate
at the boundary**: neighbouring relays exchange only the poses of occupants near a
shared edge (a coarse, low-rate summary), so a traveler sees the crowd on the far
side of a boundary without every relay holding every occupant. Full-mesh relay
federation is explicitly **out of scope for v0.1** — Tier 2 + area-of-interest
already scales to thousands per instance, which covers essentially all worlds. This
section fixes the *direction* so the wire and manifest don't foreclose it.

## 6. Scale mechanisms (normative for Tier 2+)

- **Area-of-interest (AoI):** a relay fans a pose only to occupants within a radius
  (or same sub-cell) of the sender. This is the primary scale lever — occupancy can
  grow far beyond what any client renders because each client only hears its
  neighbourhood. AoI radius is a relay/world parameter, not wire-visible.
- **Send-rate & interpolation:** clients send 10–20 Hz; receivers render ~100 ms in
  the past and interpolate (per the wire spec), so perceived smoothness is
  decoupled from packet rate and loss.
- **Optional quantization:** the wire spec's quantized profile (int16 positions,
  smallest-three rotations) is a relay capability negotiated in `welcome`; it cuts
  bandwidth per pose without changing the topology.

## 7. Discovery & identity

- **Relay discovery** is *in the world* — the manifest lists the relays. There is no
  global relay registry to capture or lose. A directory world MAY aggregate links,
  but it is never required for two people to be present together.
- **Identity** is the Passport (portable, provider-agnostic). A conformant relay
  verifies the Passport on `join` against the issuer's `jwks.json`; a self-hosted or
  dev relay MAY run open. Presence never requires a *Pixygon* account — any issuer a
  browser trusts works.

## 8. Survivability checklist (the "if the operator vanishes" test)

- ✅ No global server: worlds name their own relays; Tier 1 needs none.
- ✅ Relays are open-source & self-hostable: the reference relay runs on any box.
- ✅ Relays are swappable: `relays[]` fallback + open wire → repoint at will.
- ✅ Relays are stateless: nothing to back up or lose.
- ✅ Specs + reference code are permissively licensed and forkable.

## 9. Conformance

- A **Tier 2 relay** is conformant per [presence-wire-v0.1 §6](presence-wire-v0.1.md)
  and MUST honour `ts` stamping, the occupant list, and AoI fan-out. Certify it with
  `thread-conformance --relay wss://…`.
- A **browser** MUST support Tier 0 and SHOULD try `relays` in order (Tier 2
  failover). P2P (Tier 1) and sharding (Tier 3) are OPTIONAL capabilities a browser
  advertises; a browser that supports only Tier 2 still interoperates with every
  relay-backed world.
- A world is conformant at whatever tier it declares; declaring none is Tier 0 and
  always valid.

## 10. Status

v0.1 **specifies** all four tiers and **implements** Tier 0 (solo), Tier 2 (relay +
`relays[]` failover + AoI), and the **Tier 1 mesh core** (`loom::mesh` —
`MeshCoordinator` + the `MeshTransport` seam + the [`Signal`] rendezvous wire;
pose fan-out and peer management verified two-peer with an in-memory transport) and
the **WebRTC transport binding** (`loom::mesh_webrtc`, feature `p2p` — real data
channels + rendezvous SDP/ICE signaling + perfect-negotiation; compiles, feature-
gated). The remaining Tier-1 piece is deploying a **stateless rendezvous service**
to introduce peers (and live two-peer verification). Tier 3 (sharding/federation) is
specified and not yet implemented; the
manifest `mode`/`relays` surface and the per-sender `ts` semantics are designed so
both remaining pieces land without a breaking change.
